# Promotion & Tenure Timer

This [Flutter](http://flutter.dev/)-powered Web app provides three convenient timers. The default configuration is based on the
needs of the [College of Sciences and Humanities](https://bsu.edu/csh) Promotion & Tenure Committee at [Ball State University](https://bsu.edu).

This app is automatically built and hosted on GitHub Pages at
[https://doctor-g.github.io/PTTimer](https://doctor-g.github.io/PTTimer).

came out](http://paulgestwicki.blogspot.com/2021/09/a-custom-timer-for-p-secretaries.html).
